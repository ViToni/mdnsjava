Thus, allowing clients to use Multicast DNS (mDNS) as a substitute for DNS and not just for service discovery.\r\n\r\n### Features, Version 2.1.5\r\n* Multicast DNS (mDNS) Responder\r\n* Multicast DNS (mDNS) Querier\r\n* Service Registration/Unregistration\r\n* Browsing for Services\r\n* Browsing for DNS/mDNS Resource Records\r\n* Resolving/Looking up Services synchronously and asynchronously\r\n* Resolving/Looking up DNS/mDNS Resource Records synchronously and asynchronously\r\n* Tested with dnsjava versions 2.1.4, 2.1.5, and 2.1.6.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThis project depends on:\r\n\r\n* dnsjava.org project, version 2.1.5 or higher.

Among them is an issue where the IP header's Time To Live (TTL) value for datagrams does not get set properly. If the IP header's Time To Live (TTL) value is not set to 255, then the Java VM must be started with IPv6 disabled, using the \"-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\" VM option. This is true for IPv4 datagrams as well. Disabling IPv6 fixes the TTL issue for IPv4.\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\n    java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar mdnsjava.jar dnssd -E\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nmdnsjava was created by Steve Posick (@posicks) as part of a Proof of Concept application for the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ([SMPTE](http://www.smpte.org/)) suite of standards on Media & Device Control over IP networks, [[SMPTE ST2071](http://standards.smpte.org/search?fulltext=2071&smptes-status=in-force&submit=yes&content-group=smptes)]. The SMPTE ST2071 suite of standards defines an open standard for the representation of devices and services within an Internet of Things (IoT) using uniquely identified feature interfaces, similar in principle to uniquely identified Microservice interfaces, and defines extensions for the DNS-SD protocol that allow for the service discovery DNS infrastructure to be separated from the name resolution DNS infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
